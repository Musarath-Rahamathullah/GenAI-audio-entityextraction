## Features

- **Conversational UI**: The app provides a chat-like interface for seamless interaction with the AI assistant.
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload various types of documents (PDF, CSV, TXT, PNG, JPG, XLSX, JSON, DOCX, Python scripts etc) to provide context for the AI assistant.
- **Caching**: Uploaded documents and extracted text are cached in an S3 bucket for improved performance.
- **Chat History**: The app stores and retrieves chat history from a DynamoDB table, allowing users to continue conversations across sessions.
- **Model Selection**: Users can select different Anthropic models (Claude-3-Sonnet, Claude-3-Haiku, Claude-Instant-V1, Claude-V2, Claude-V2:1) for their queries.
- **Cost Tracking**: The application calculates and displays the cost associated with each chat session based on the input and output token counts and the pricing model defined in the `pricing.json` file.
- **Logging**: The items logged in the DynamoDB table include the user ID, session ID, messages, timestamps,uploaded documents s3 path, input and output token counts. This helps to isolate user engagement statistics and track the various items being logged, as well as attribute the cost per user.

There are two files of interest.
1. A Jupyter Notebook that walks you through the ChatBot Implementation cell by cell.
2. A Streamlit app that can be deployed to create a UI Chatbot.

### Pre-Requisites
1. [Amazon Bedrock Anthropic Claude Model Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)
2. [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) to store uploaded documents and Textract output.
3. Optional:
    - Create an Amazon DynamoDB table to store chat history (Run the notebook **BedrockChatUI** to create a DynamoDB Table). This is optional as there is a local disk storage option, however, I would recommend using Amazon DynamoDB.
    - Amazon Textract. This is optional as there is an option to use python libraries [`pypdf2`](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) and [`pytessesract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) for PDF and image processing. However, I would recommend using Amazon Textract for higher quality PDF and image processing. You will experience latency when using `pytesseract`.

## To run this Streamlit App on Sagemaker Studio follow the steps below:

## Configuration
The application's behavior can be customized by modifying the `config.json` file. Here are the available options:

- `DynamodbTable`: The name of the DynamoDB table to use for storing chat history. Leave this field empty if you decide to use local storage for chat history.
- `UserId`: The DynamoDB user ID for the application. Leave this field empty if you decide to use local storage for chat history.
- `Bucket_Name`: The name of the S3 bucket used for caching documents and extracted text. This is required.
- `max-output-token`: The maximum number of output tokens allowed for the AI assistant's response.
- `chat-history-loaded-length`: The number of recent chat messages to load from the DynamoDB table or Local storage.
- `bedrock-region`: The AWS region where Amazon Bedrock is enabled.
- `load-doc-in-chat-history`: A boolean flag indicating whether to load documents in the chat history. If `true` all documents would be loaded in chat history as context (provides more context of previous chat history to the AI at the cost of additional price and latency). If `false` only the user query and response would be loaded in the chat history, the AI would have no recollection of any document context from those chat conversations. When setting boolean in JSON use all lower caps.
- `AmazonTextract`: A boolean indicating whether to use Amazon Textract or python libraries for PDF and image processing. Set to `false` if you do not have access to Amazon Textract. When setting boolean in JSON use all lower caps.
- `csv-delimiter`: The delimiter to use when parsing structured content to string. Supported formats are "|", "\t", and ",".
- `document-upload-cache-s3-path`: S3 bucket path to cache uploaded files. Do not include the bucket name, just the prefix without a trailing slash. For example "path/to/files".
- `AmazonTextract-result-cache`: S3 bucket path to cache Amazon Textract result. Do not include the bucket name, just the prefix without a trailing slash. For example "path/to/files".

If You have a sagemaker Studio Domain already set up, ignore the first item, however, item 2 is required.
* [Set Up SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html) 
* SageMaker execution role should have access to interact with [Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-setup.html), [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html) and optionally [Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonTextractFullAccess.html) and [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-specific-table-indexes.html) if these services are used.
* [Launch SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-launch.html)
* [Clone this git repo into studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tasks-git.html)
* Open a system terminal by clicking on **Amazon SageMaker Studio** and then **System Terminal** as shown in the diagram below
* <img src="images/studio-new-launcher.png" width="600"/>
* Navigate into the cloned repository directory using the `cd` command and run the command `pip install -r req.txt` to install the needed python libraries.
* If you decide to use Python Libs for PDF and image processing, this requires tesserect-ocr. Run the following command:
    - sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    - sudo yum -y update
    - sudo yum install -y tesseract
* Run command `python3 -m streamlit run bedrock-chat.py --server.enableXsrfProtection false` to start the Streamlit server. Do not use the links generated by the command as they won't work in studio.
* To enter the Streamlit app, open and run the cell in the **StreamlitLink.ipynb** notebook. This will generate the appropiate link to enter your Streamlit app from SageMaker studio. Click on the link to enter your Streamlit app.
* **⚠ Note:**  If you rerun the Streamlit server it may use a different port. Take not of the port used (port number is the last 4 digit number after the last : (colon)) and modify the `port` variable in the `StreamlitLink.ipynb` notebook to get the correct link.

## To run this Streamlit App on AWS EC2 (I tested this on the Ubuntu Image)
* [Create a new ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
* Expose TCP port range 8500-8510 on Inbound connections of the attached Security group to the ec2 instance. TCP port 8501 is needed for Streamlit to work. See image below
* <img src="images/sg-rules.png" width="600"/>
* EC2 [instance profile role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) has the required permissions to access the services used by this application mentioned above.
* [Connect to your ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html)
* Run the appropiate commands to update the ec2 instance (`sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` -for Ubuntu)
* Clone this git repo `git clone [github_link]`
* Install python3 and pip if not already installed, `sudo apt install python3` and `sudo apt install python3-pip`.
* If you decide to use Python Libs for PDF and image processing, this requires tesserect-ocr. Run the following command:
    - If using Centos-OS or Amazon-Linux:
        - sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
        - sudo yum -y update
        - sudo yum install -y tesseract
    - For Ubuntu or Debian:
        - sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-all -y
* Install the dependencies by running the command `sudo pip install -r req.txt`
* Run command `tmux new -s mysession` to create a new session. Then in the new session created `cd` into the **ChatBot** dir and run `python3 -m streamlit run bedrock-chat.py` to start the streamlit app. This allows you to run the Streamlit application in the background and keep it running even if you disconnect from the terminal session.
* Copy the **External URL** link generated and paste in a new browser tab.
To stop the `tmux` session, in your ec2 terminal Press `Ctrl+b`, then `d` to detach. to kill the session, run `tmux kill-session -t mysession`

## Limitations and Future Updates
1. **Limited Bedrock Model Selection**: The application currently supports a fixed set of Bedrock models, including "claude-3-sonnet", "claude-3-haiku", "claude-instant-v1", "claude-v2:1", and "claude-v2". Allowing users to select from a wider range of Bedrock models would make the application more versatile.

2. **Pricing**: Pricing is only calculated for the Bedrock models not including cost of any other AWS service used. In addition, the pricing information of the models are stored in a static `pricing.json` file. Do manually update the file to refelct current [Bedrock pricing details](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/). Use this cost implementation in this app as a rough estimate of actual cost of interacting with the Bedrock models as actual cost reported in your account may differ.

3. **Storage Encryption**: This application does not implement storing and reading files to and from S3 and/or DynamoDB using KMS keys for data at rest encryption.

4. **Production-Ready**: For an enterprise and production-ready chatbot application architecture pattern, check out [Generative AI Application Builder on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/generative-ai-application-builder-on-aws/) and [Bedrock-Claude-Chat](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-claude-chat) for best practices and recommendations.

5. **Tools**: Implement function (tool) calling for extended more specialized document query especially for structured data.

## Application Workflow Diagram

**Guidelines**
- When a document is uploaded (and for everytime it stays uploaded), its content is attached to the user's query, and the chatbot's responses are grounded in the document ( a sperate prompt template is used). That chat conversation is tagged with the document name as metadata to be used in the chat history.
- If the document is detached, the chat history will only contain the user's queries and the chatbot's responses, unless the `load-doc-in-chat-history` configuration parameter is enabled, in which case the document content will be retained in the chat history.
- You can refer to documents by their names of format (PDF, WORD, IMAGE etc) when having a conversation with the AI.
- The `chat-history-loaded-length` setting determines how many previous conversations the LLM will be aware of, including any attached documents (if the `load-doc-in-chat-history` option is enabled). A higher value for this setting means that the LLM will have access to more historical context, but it may also increase the cost and potentially introduce latency, as more tokens will be inputted into the LLM. For optimal performance and cost-effectiveness, it's recommended to set the 'chat-history-loaded-length' to a value between 5 and 10. This range strikes a balance between providing the LLM with sufficient historical context while minimizing the input payload size and associated costs.
- ⚠️ When using the Streamlit app, any uploaded document will be persisted for the current chat conversation. This means that subsequent questions, as well as chat histories (if the 'load-doc-in-chat-history' option is enabled), will have the document(s) as context, and the responses will be grounded in that document(s). However, this can increase the cost and latency, as the input payload will be larger due to the loaded document(s) in every chat turn. Therefore if you have the `load-doc-in-chat-history` option enabled, after your first question response with the uploaded document(s), it is recommended to remove the document(s) by clicking the **X** sign next to the uploaded file(s). The document(s) will be saved in the chat history, and you can ask follow-up questions about it, as the LLM will have knowledge of the document(s) from the chat history. On the other hand, if the `load-doc-in-chat-history` option is disabled, and you want to keep asking follow-up questions about the document(s), leave the document(s) uploaded until you are done. This way, only the current chat turn will have the document(s) loaded, and not the entire chat history. The choice between enabling `load-doc-in-chat-history` or not is dependent on cost and latency. I would recommend enabling for a smoother experience following the aforementioned guidelines.
